## Write-up

it's easy challenge all you need is to answer the questions:

 1-first question is encrypted by bacon cipher as the hint said (or you can just google it) 
 
 2-second question is morse encoded (you can use any morse decoder)
 
 3-third question about calculating Euler's totient of number n :
 	since n is not that large we factorise it to two prime numbers p and q (you can use factordb.com)
 	when we get p and q we calculate ** phi = (p-1)(q-1) **
